# Module 5 Challenge | Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
## Work Day Scheduler
## Description
This is the completed application of the password generator for the Module 5 Work Day Scheduler challenge. The purpose of this challenge was to make a simple calendar application to save events for each hour of the work day. The app runs in the broswer and features HTML and CSS code that is powered by jQuery. The scheduler displays the current date at the top. It also features color-coded time blocks to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future. It also allows the user to enter and save the event, while also making sure that the saved events persist even after refreshing the page.
